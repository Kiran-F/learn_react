Adding all the files while I'm trying to learn react.

Creating a react app:
1. run the command "npm create vite@latest".
    Select "React"
    Select "javaScript"
2. To install node, get into the react folder and run the command "npm install".
    The node_modules folder would be included.
3. To run the project, run the scripts. -> "npm run dev".

React is a library. In framework naming convention is strictly followed.
